# Jenkins Job Types

![Jenkins Job Types](./images/job_types.png)

Jenkins provides several types of jobs to suit different project needs. Each job type has its own strengths and use cases.

## 1. Freestyle Project

### Overview
The **simplest and most flexible** job type in Jenkins. Perfect for beginners and simple build tasks.

### Key Features
- GUI-based configuration
- Point-and-click setup
- No coding required
- Supports various build steps (shell scripts, batch commands, etc.)

### Use Cases
- Simple build and deploy tasks
- Running scripts or commands
- Basic CI/CD workflows

### Example Configuration
1. Add build steps (Execute shell, Invoke Maven, etc.)
2. Configure post-build actions
3. Set up triggers (SCM polling, webhooks)

## 2. Pipeline

### Overview
**Code-based job configuration** using Jenkinsfile. Infrastructure as Code approach for CI/CD.

### Key Features
- Written in Groovy DSL
- Version controlled (Jenkinsfile)
- Two syntaxes: Declarative and Scripted
- Supports complex workflows
- Pausable and resumable

### Declarative Pipeline Example
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building...'
                sh 'mvn clean package'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing...'
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying...'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Use Cases
- Complex CI/CD workflows
- Projects requiring version-controlled build configuration
- Multi-stage deployments
- Projects needing approval gates

## 3. Multibranch Pipeline

### Overview
**Automatically creates pipelines** for each branch in your repository.

### Key Features
- Auto-discovers branches
- Creates/deletes jobs as branches are created/deleted
- Each branch gets its own build history
- Requires Jenkinsfile in each branch

### How It Works
1. Scans repository for branches
2. Creates a sub-project for each branch with a Jenkinsfile
3. Builds branches based on triggers
4. Cleans up when branches are deleted

### Use Cases
- Projects with multiple active branches

## 4. Folder

### Overview
**Organizational structure** for grouping related jobs together.

### Key Features
- Groups jobs logically
- Shared configuration across jobs
- Nested folders support
- Access control at folder level
- Environment variables inheritance

### Structure Example
```
üìÅ Frontend Team
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ React App Build
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ Vue App Build
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ Testing Jobs
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ E2E Tests
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ Unit Tests
```

### Use Cases
- Organizing jobs by team
- Grouping by project or application
- Separating environments (Dev/Stage/Prod)
- Managing permissions by folder

## 5. Organization Folder

### Overview
**Scans an entire GitHub/Bitbucket/GitLab organization** and creates jobs for all repositories.

### Key Features
- Auto-discovers all repositories
- Creates Multibranch Pipeline for each repo
- Monitors for new repositories
- Configurable scanning criteria
- Supports regex filtering

### How It Works
1. Connects to GitHub/Bitbucket/GitLab organization
2. Scans all repositories
3. Creates Multibranch Pipeline for repos with Jenkinsfile
4. Continuously monitors for new repos

### Use Cases
- Large organizations with many repositories
- Microservices architectures
- Standardized CI/CD across all projects
- Self-service CI/CD for development teams
